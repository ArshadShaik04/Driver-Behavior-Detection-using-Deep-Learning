# ðŸš— Driver Behavior Detection using Deep Learning  

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview  
This project aims to detect and classify driver behaviors using deep learning models. The system categorizes driving activities into **five classes** based on image data:  
- âœ… **Safe Driving**  
- ðŸ“± **Texting on the Phone**  
- ðŸ“ž **Talking on the Phone**  
- ðŸ”„ **Turning**  
- ðŸ”€ **Other Activities**  

By leveraging **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**, we built and evaluated **AlexNet, ResNet34, and VGGNet** models to classify driver behaviors with high accuracy.
