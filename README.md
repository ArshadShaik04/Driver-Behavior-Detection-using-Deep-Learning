# 🚗 Driver Behavior Detection using Deep Learning  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project detects and classifies driver behaviors using deep learning models. The system categorizes driving activities into five classes:  
- ✅ Safe Driving  
- 📱 Texting on the Phone  
- 📞 Talking on the Phone  
- 🔄 Turning  
- 🔀 Other Activities  

We implemented and tested **AlexNet, ResNet34, and VGGNet**, with **AlexNet achieving the highest accuracy (98.1%)**.
